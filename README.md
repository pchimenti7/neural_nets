# neural_nets
This repository contains ipython notebooks which walk through the steps of building artificial neural network models.  The comments will be more detailed than most examples found on the web to faciliate learning.  A list of notebooks with brief descriptions is provided below.  Content will be updated regularly.

* income_model_binary_nn.ipynb - This notebook builds a neural net version of the model from the income_model_binary.ipynb notebook in the gradient_boosting repository.  It is a very basic model and is meant only to be instructive.  Some references are made to the boosted tree model previously built.

* transfer_learning_image.ipynb - This notebook exploits transfer learning to build an image classifier.  The well known CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) data set and Inception V3 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) are used.

* style_transfer.ipynb - This notebook performs a simple style transfer.  You can load your own images into an 'images' folder to practice on your own.
